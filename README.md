## Why did i use vue insted of React?

<p>
 I decided to use Vue.js in this project to explore different libraries and frameworks. Even though I'm more comfortable with React, getting it to work was pretty straightforward. I like the simplicity of the Composition API over the Options API. Right now, I prefer React and JSX, but I'm not ruling out working with Vue again in the future.
